# PacMan
## PacMan Excercise
This excersice adds Pac men to the page. Each PacMan should run at random speeds across the screen to the edge and return.

How to Run: Once the page loads you can select the "Add PacMan" button and then select the "Start Game" button to get him moving. Select the "Add PacMan" again to see additional PacMen added to the page. You should be able to load the index.html file on your browser or go to ccgarrison.github.io README and click on the link.

Future Improvements: Having problems actually showing the Pacmen on the screen. Work to improve coding. Resolve problem with showing images and change PacMan colors.
